# Super Fake Store

- This project was created as part of a coding bootcamp.
- I mainly worked with the array methods filter(), forEach(), and sort()
- the learning objective of this project:
- learning how to use fetch and APIs
- how to sort and filter them
- creating dynamic Elements with JS
- clean and dynamic code
